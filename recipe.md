First put down your bowl.

Have you done that yet? No? I'll wait a little longer.





Now done? No? How are you taking this much time!










Now done? Finally! Ok, the next step is to put in the spoon.

Done? No? This is going to take a while.








Now done? Good! That was sooner than expected! Now you need to put in the cereal.



Are you done? No? I expected as much.







Now are you done? Still no? I'll wait.













Ok, *now* are you done? Good! So next you want to put in milk, but not to much milk. I'll tell you when to stop putting milk in.

Keep going . . .

Keep going . . .

Keep going . . .

Stop!

Good, you stopped at the right time! I thought that you might put to much in! Well now you're ready!

Oh . . . The nuclear reactor? I don't remember putting that in!
Hold on, let me check





Oh yeah! I did put that in! I remember now! But why did I put that in? Oh yeah! I thought we were making radioactive cereal when I wrote the list, but then I decided not to but I forgot to edit the list. Silly me! I hope that didn't cost too much.

Anyways, thats the end of the recipe! I hope the cereal tastes good! Also, did you always have three arms?
